// Part 1
//  Your program should ask the user for a stop code, 
// and print a list of the next five buses at that stop code, 
// with their routes, destinations, 
// and the time until they arrive in minutes.




// Your aim is to build an application which, 
// given a postcode, finds the two nearest bus stops, 
// and shows the next five buses due at each.
